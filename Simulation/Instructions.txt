Algorithms Scheduler

This program is designed to test run the following Algorithms on given task sets:
EDF

It will also return the time it took to run the algorithm,
or given a desired number of runs, the average time to run the algorithm.

The program will read in the Task Sets from a text file in the given format:


Begin <indicates the beginning of a new Task Set>
<number of tasks>
<number of processors>
<Y or N indicating if it's preemptive> ( bỏ qua, luôn dùng hàng đợi ưu tiên tiến trình có deadline sớm hơn được ưu tiên)
<start time>,<computation time>,<soft deadline>(bỏ qua),<hard deadline>,<period>

If a value doesn't exist in a task set, set the value to 0.

Here is an example Task Set:

Begin
3  // 3 tiến trình
1 // 1 processors
Y
0,2,5,5,5 //  start 0 computation 2 hard deadline 5 period 5
1,1,4,4,4
2,2,20,20,20

Notice: For files that have a large amount of taskSets, the LCM has the possibility of an overflow.
        To stop this, the max the LCM could be for any task set is 500.
