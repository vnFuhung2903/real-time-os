# Project : Real-time Operating System (RTOS)

## Detail
 Develop or enhance an operating system to support real-time requirements, 
ensuring timely and predictable responses to external events
## Hint
Learn about real-time scheduling algorithms, priority inversion, and techniques for 
minimizing latency. Consider how to guarantee deadlines for critical tasks
